# UCF Rest Menus
This is a WordPress plugin that creates a read only rest api for menus within WordPress.

This plugin is heavily based on the wp-api-menus plugin which can be found [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/). In the initial commit of the plugin, the code is almost exactly the same as the v2 code of the original. Because functionality within UCF themes will be dependent upon this plugin, the code was slightly modified and put within its own repository to prevent incompatibilties from arising as the  original plugin author makes changes.

## Compatibility
WordPress 4.4+

## Dependencies
Must run on WordPress 4.4+ as it utilizes the Rest API. 

## Installation
1. Download the zipped project and extract to `/wp-contentn/plugins/` within your WordPress installation directory.
2. Activate the plugin within the Admin screen.
3. Enjoy!
